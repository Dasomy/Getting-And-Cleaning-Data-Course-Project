# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is for submitting the course project for 'Getting and Cleaning Data' in the Data Science Track, offered by Johns Hopkins University from Coursera.

## About the Data
The data used for this analysis is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set". <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>
Download the data by clicking this link --> <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>
After extracting, keep features.txt and activity_labels.txt in the working directory, X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt under "test" in the working directory, and X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt under "train" in the working directory.

## About the Files
The repository holds three files - run_analysis.R, CodeBook.md, and average_data.txt.
* run_analysis.R : This is an R script that performs analysis on the data according to the project requirements.
* CodeBook.md : This codebook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data.
* average_data.txt : This is the final output from run_analysis.R. When the code is executed, it is saved to the working directory.
